Hi, 
I’m Andreas Scharf and I'm interested in modern software development, physics and more ....
I’m currently learning 
  - simple ray tracing in C++ and CUDA
  - data structures (C++)
  - algorithms (C++)
  - some machine learning (python)

I’m looking to collaborate on an open source project that fits my interests and my current learning topics.
