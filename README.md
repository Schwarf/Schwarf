Hi, 

I’m Andreas Scharf and as a physicist I'm interested in modern software development:
Currently my main focus lies on 
  - algorithms and data structures in C++, C++17 and C++20 
  - hypothesis testing in statistics using python and C++

From time to time I try to improve my understanding
  - on multithreading programming in C++ and CUDA
  - machine learning in python

I’m looking to collaborate on an open source project that fits my interests and my current learning topics.
