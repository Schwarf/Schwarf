Hi, 

I’m Andreas Scharf and as a physicist I'm interested in modern software development.
Currently my main focus lies on 
  - algorithms and data structures in C++, C++17 and C++20 
  - how to write android apps in Kotlin
  - learning Golang

From time to time I try to improve my understanding
  - on multithreading programming in C++ and CUDA
  - machine-/deep-learning in python

I’m looking to collaborate on an open source project that fits my interests and my current learning topics.
