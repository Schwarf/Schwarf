### Hi, I’m Andreas 👋

Senior software engineer with a physics background, with interests in **algorithms**, **performance**, and **numerics**.

---

## What I’m working on
- **Modern C++ (C++17/20)** — algorithms, cache-aware data structures, profiling & microbenchmarks
- **Concurrency fundamentals** — lock-free data structures, atomics, memory ordering  
- **Go** — graph & numerics tooling and first steps into distributed systems
- **Python** — using Python for analysis, tooling, quick experiments, and some deep learning
 
---

## Selected open-source work
- **NetworKit (C++)** — graph algorithms & performance improvements; tests and code quality
- **Gonum (Go)** — graph algorithms and special functions (e.g., Li₂) with benchmarks
- **Personal repos** — algorithms, concurrency playgrounds, and small utilities
