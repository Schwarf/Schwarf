Hi, I’m Andreas 👋

Senior software engineer with a background in theoretical physics, specializing in
performance-critical systems, algorithms, and numerical software.

### Focus areas
- **Modern C++ (C++17/20)** — algorithm engineering, cache-aware data structures,
  profiling, benchmarking, and correctness-driven design
- **Graph algorithms & numerics** — both theoretical foundations and practical,
  large-scale implementations
- **Go** — graph algorithms, numerical libraries, and initial work on
  distributed-systems-adjacent tooling
- **Python** — analysis, tooling, experiments, and ML-adjacent prototyping

### Selected open-source work
- **NetworKit (C++)** — graph algorithms, planarity testing, and substantial
  performance optimizations; extensive testing and benchmarking
- **Gonum (Go)** — graph algorithms and numerical special functions
  (e.g. dilogarithm Li₂), with benchmarks and performance analysis
- **Personal repositories** — algorithm implementations, performance experiments,
  and systems-programming playgrounds

### Toolbox
C++17/20 (GCC/Clang) · Go · Python · CMake · GoogleTest / Google Benchmark ·
Valgrind / Callgrind · Docker · GitHub Actions · Linux

<sub>Past explorations: Android/Kotlin · CUDA (introductory GPU concurrency experiments)</sub>
